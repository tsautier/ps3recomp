"""Self-check for objdump_audit's line parser + decoder agreement.

No SDK/objdump needed: feed a synthetic objdump snippet (real Cell instruction words) and
assert the parser recovers address/word/mnemonic -- including a record-form ".": the trailing
dot is exactly what a naive \\w+ regex drops, silently mis-diffing every dot-form. Then check
our own decoder agrees on the same words (directly or via a known simplified-mnemonic alias).

Run: python tools/test_objdump_audit.py
