"""disasm_audit.py - PPU decoder cross-check: tools/ppu_disasm.py vs Capstone.

Purpose: catch the crnand/crnor bug class (decode-table swaps/scrambles --
the most expensive bug class in project history) EXHAUSTIVELY, in one run,
by decoding every 4-byte word of the game's executable segments with two
independent decoders and diffing the mnemonics.

Decoders:
  (a) ours   -- tools/ppu_disasm.py's decode()
  (b) oracle -- Capstone, CS_ARCH_PPC + CS_MODE_64 + CS_MODE_BIG_ENDIAN

Capstone is an OPTIONAL, DEV-ONLY dependency (`py -3 -m pip install
capstone`). It must NEVER be imported by runtime/lifter code -- this script
is the only place in the repo that touches it, and it degrades to a one-line
install hint if the import fails (never a crash or a silent skip).

Scope (v1): MNEMONIC comparison only. Operand normalization is a planned v2.
Known alias classes -- where Capstone's *simplified* PowerPC
mnemonic legitimately differs from our *canonical* mnemonic for the exact
same encoding -- are handled via an explicit WHITELIST table below, each
entry MEASURED against a hand-built encoding + both decoders (see the
comments next to ALIAS_WHITELIST). Whitelisted pairs are reported separately
as INFO, never counted as mismatches.

Usage:
    py -3 tools\\disasm_audit.py game\\EBOOT.elf [--limit N] [--top N]
                                 [--dump-mismatches FILE]
    py -3 tools\\disasm_audit.py --self-test        (seeded-bug harness)

Exit code: 0 if residual (non-whitelisted) mismatch count is 0, else 1.
Always runs to completion and prints the full report either way -- the exit
code is a machine-checkable summary, not a reason to stop early.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Alias RULES (pattern-based, not literal pairs)
#
# 1. Branch-prediction hint suffix ('+'/'-'): the PowerPC BO field's "at"
#    hint bits (Book I p.20 Fig.22: at=10 not-taken '-', at=11 taken '+')
#    are a pure annotation -- tools/ppu_disasm.py never emits them, Capstone
#    always does when at != 00. MEASURED across many real base mnemonics
#    (blt/blt+, bdz/bdz-, beq/beq-, bdnz/bdnz+, bsola/bsola+, bdzla/bdzla-,
#    ...); a literal per-mnemonic whitelist would be an unbounded list, so
#    this is a suffix RULE instead: capstone_mn in (ours_mn+'+', ours_mn+'-').
#
# 2. Friendly condition-name vs raw bit-test name on COMBINED decrement+
#    condition branches (bdnz/bdz + true/false condition): ours spells the
#    derived friendly name (bdnzge, bdnzle, bdnzne, bdnzns for the "false"
#    tests; bdnzlt/bdnzgt/bdnzeq/bdnzso for the "true" tests, and the bdz
#    analogs), Capstone keeps the raw bdnzt/bdnzf/bdzt/bdzf root + the CR
#    bit name as an operand (e.g. bdnzf 'lt'). MEASURED at BO=0..3 (dnz+
#    false) and BO=8..11 (dnz+true), and the bdz (BO=2/3, 10/11) analogs.
#    Rule: capstone_mn in ('bdnzt','bdnzf','bdzt','bdzf') and
#          ours_mn startswith the matching 'bdnz'/'bdz' root.
#
# 3. tdi/twi TO-field friendly names: ours always prints the raw numeric TO
#    field (tdi TO,rA,SI); Capstone maps common TO values to friendly names
#    (tdlgti = TO=1 "logical greater than immediate", tdlti = TO=16
#    "logical less than immediate", etc. -- the full TO table has ~10
#    named combinations). MEASURED at 0x0110D834 (TO=1 -> tdlgti) and
#    0x0110C308 (TO=16 -> tdlti); BOTH sample sites are OUTSIDE any
#    functions.json range (confirmed via bisect over functions.json), i.e.
#    these are very likely data-in-.text words being guessed at by both
#    decoders, not real trap instructions -- flagged as INFO either way
#    since the mnemonic-alias relationship itself is real and documented
#    (see PPC_Vers202_Book1_public.pdf's trap extended-mnemonic table).
#    Rule: ours_mn in ('tdi','twi') and capstone_mn startswith the
#          corresponding 't'+('d'|'w') root.
