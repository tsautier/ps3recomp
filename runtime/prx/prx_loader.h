/*
 * prx_loader.h — runtime loader for statically-recompiled PS3 PRX modules.
 *
 * A relocatable PRX (libsre, libresc, ...) is brought into a static recompile
 * in three artifacts produced offline:
 *
 *   1. tools/prx_relocate.py  -> a LINKED image: the PRX segments flattened to
 *      a base-0 blob with every PT_SCE_PPURELA relocation pre-applied at a
 *      fixed load base B (value = B + addend). The image bytes are final.
 *   2. tools/ppu_lifter.py --base B --symbol-prefix P_  -> host C functions for
 *      the module's code, with B-based guest addresses and P_-namespaced
 *      symbols (P_func_*, P_function_table[]) so they link beside the title.
 *   3. The namespaced P_function_table[] (a func_entry array) maps each guest
 *      address (B + offset) to its lifted host function.
 *
 * At runtime this loader does the two things that turn those artifacts into a
 * live module:
 *
 *   A. Copies the relocated image into guest RAM at B, so the module's data,
 *      function descriptors (OPDs) and pointer tables are visible to both the
 *      lifted code (vm_read*) and the host indirect-call dispatcher (OPD walk).
 *   B. Registers every lifted function at its guest address in the host
 *      dispatch table, so guest bctrl/branch through a B-region address lands
 *      in the right host function.
 *
 * The loader is intentionally decoupled from any one title: the host supplies
 * the dispatch registrar (a function pointer) and the guest-memory base. This
 * mirrors the existing cross-repo seam (the runtime owns mechanism; the game
 * owns its dispatch table).
