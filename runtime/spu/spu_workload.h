/* spu_workload.h — SPU workload / task dispatch registry.
 *
 * The bridge cellSpurs needs: when a title registers a SPURS workload
 * (cellSpursAddWorkload, a "policy module" SPU binary) or a SPURS task
 * (cellSpursCreateTask, a task ELF), the runtime must actually RUN that SPU
 * program. We do not interpret SPU ELFs at runtime — we statically lift each
 * title's SPU binaries ahead of time (spu_lifter -> a native entry fn). This
 * layer maps a registered SPU image, by content FINGERPRINT, to its pre-lifted
 * native entry, loads the image into a fresh 256 KB local store, and runs it
 * with the SPURS task ABI (job/task arg EA in r3) via the lifted-job adapter.
 *
 * Flow:
 *   1) At init, the title's generated registration code calls
 *      spu_workload_register(fingerprint, lifted_entry, "name") once per lifted
 *      SPU binary. The fingerprint is FNV-1a-64 over the exact ELF image bytes
 *      (the same bytes the title later hands to cellSpurs), computed identically
 *      here and by the offline extractor (so a manifest can be emitted).
 *   2) cellSpursAddWorkload / cellSpursCreateTask call spu_workload_dispatch()
 *      with the guest image -> fingerprint -> lifted entry -> load LS -> run.
 *
 * This is title-agnostic ps3recomp runtime: the registry is populated by the
 * title's lifted SPU set; the dispatch mechanism is generic.
